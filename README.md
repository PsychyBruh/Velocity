  Velocity
</h1>

<p align="center">
  A fully featured web browser built using web technologies.
</p>

## About

The initial inspiration for Velocity came from other proxies such as Hypertabs and Rammerhead Browser. After using these proxies issues arose that broke the illusion of using a web browser which velocity attempts to fix.

## Features

- Sleek Firefox inspired UI
- Proper link handling
- Script injection for native functions

## Internal URL's

- `about:newTab` - New tab page
- `about:preferences` - Preferences page
- `about:history` - History page
- `about:blank` - Blank document
- `view-source:*` - View source page

## Commands

Velocity implements many commands that web browsers commonly use in order to do certain functions. Due to the limitations of JavaScript many of these have to be adapted but listed below is all commands that have been implemented so far.

- `Ctrl + R` - Reload current tab
- `Ctrl + E` - Search
- `Ctrl + U` - View page source
- `Ctrl + Shift + I` - Open developer tools
- `Alt + ArrowLeft` - Navigate backwards in history
- `Alt + ArrowRight` - Navigate forward in history
- `Ctrl + D` - Bookmark current page
- `Ctrl + Shift + B` - Toggle bookmarks bar
- `Ctrl + H` - Open history

### Adapted commands

- `Alt + T` - Open new tab (originally `Ctrl + T`)
- `Alt + W` - Close current tab (originally `Ctrl + W`)

## API

Velocity exposes basic APIs in order to allow developers to easily create customizations and implement it into their own projects. To learn more, check out the [API Docs](/docs/API.md).

## Deployment

### Requirements

- [NodeJS version >=18](https://nodejs.org/)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cohenerickson/Velocity.git
cd Velocity
npm i
npm run build
npm start
```

## Roadmap

Velocity is still in it's early stages but if it gains enough interest among the community there are quite a few other features that I would like to implement, listed below are a few of these.

- Bookmarklet support
- Extension support
- And more...
